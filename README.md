# Road-Accident-Dashboard-PowerBI

Analyzed road accident casualties within previous years and the current year in order to display trends and patterns within the PowerBI dashboard that I have created from scratch. Utilizing MS powerpoint and PowerBI, multiple graphs and figures were created as well as calculations that will assist in producing driving legislation for years to come.

Research Questions:
1. Find the Total Casualties and Total Acident Values for Current Year and Year on Year Growth.
2. Find the Total Casulaties by Accident Severity for Current Year and Year on Year Growth.
3. Find the Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for the current year.
4. Display the monthly trend for casulaties in the current year versus previous year.
5. Display the casualties by road type for the current year.
6. Group the current year casualties by day/night time.
